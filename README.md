# COVID19_Spatial_Model
This repository contains the implementation of the model described in the paper "A flexible age-dependent spatially-stratified COVID-19 predictive model accounting for multiple viral variants and vaccines". 

The script Spatial_Model_Germany.jl illustrate the implementation of the model assuming one location (here the case of Germany). The code can be adapted to any country. The model parameters must be chosen accordingly. The comments in the scripts and the model description in the paper are good guides to help adapt the code to the considered country.
